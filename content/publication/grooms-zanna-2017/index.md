abstract: 'Porta Mana and Zanna (2014) recently proposed a subgrid-scale parameterization for eddy-permitting quasigeostrophic models. In this model the large-scale fluid is represented as a non-Newtonian viscoelastic medium, with a subgrid-stress closure that involves the Lagrangian derivative of large-scale quantities. This note derives this parameterization, including the nondimensional proportionality coefficient, using only two statistical assumptions: that the subgrid-scale term is locally homogeneous and decorrelates rapidly in space. The parameterization is then verified by comparing against eddy-resolving quasigeostrophic simulations, independently reproducing the results of Porta Mana and Zanna in a simpler model.'
