Ocean Heat Content and Thermosteric Sea Level

<!--more-->

The original data from our PNAS paper can be dowloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wx3fj4w61b8yyud/OHC_GF_global.nc?dl=0)

We are continuously working on updating the datasets fairly regularly (thanks to many comments and sugg
estions over the recent weeks). For the most recent update (March 15th, v0) which include:

extending back to 1870 (rather than 1871),

adding year 2018

using Sea Surface Temperatures from NOAA Extended Reconstruction SSTsV4, COBE (in addition to HadISSTv1 and realisations from HadISST v2)

thermal expansion coefficients calculated using annual-mean climatology for 2005-2012 of WOA2013.

The datasets for the upper 300 m, upper 700 m, upper 2000 m, below 2000 m, and full depth (with errors defined as one-SD and derived from perturbing the Greenâ€™s Functions and from the use of different SSTs) are here:
