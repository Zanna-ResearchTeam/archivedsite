FAFMIP is an atmosphere-ocean general circulation model intercomparison project of CMIP6. It addresses aspects of the Earth system response to forcing, and is of particular relevance to the WCRP Grand Challenge on sea level rise and regional impacts. Its goal is to explain the model spread in AOGCM projections of ocean climate change forced by CO2 increase.
