We observe and predict a range of extremes events in precipitation, sea level, and air or ocean temperatures. Some of these events are rare but are of large amplitudes. Sampling their statistics and undertanding their dynamical drivers are important for climate detection, attribution and adaption. These extreme events are a reflection of the complex and non-linear dynamics governing the climate system. We are interested in addressing the following:

- What are the dynamical drivers of the extreme events in sea surface temperatures or sea level? (e.g., [Rodrigues et al. 2019](/publication/rodrigues-et-al-2019/), [Yin et al. 2019](/publication/yin-et-al-2019/))

- How anthropogenic climate change has affected or will affect extreme events in the ocean and atmosphere? ([Yin et al. 2019](/publication/yin-et-al-2019/))

- How to best describe forced-dissipative turbulent system from their statistics? (e.g., [David et al. 2018](/publication/david-et-al-2018/), [David et al. 2017](/publication/david-et-al-2017/))
