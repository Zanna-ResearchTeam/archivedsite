TICTOC is a multi-institute NERC funded grant with the aim of studying regional ocean heat content change and sea level rise. TICTOC will use observations made from research ships and computer models of the ocean to understand where the ocean takes up heat from the atmosphere and how ocean currents transport and redistribute that heat.
